# Fine-tuning ParsBERT LLM for text classification

In this repository, I fine-tuned the ParsBERT LLM which is the fine-tune version of BERT for Persian language.

I fine-tuned the ParsBERT to classify the sentiment of social media messages about stock market. For the sentiment, I mean to classify which messages are expected the market to go up, positive (bullish), and which of them are expecting the market to go down, negative (bearish).
I scraped the message from the website [Sahamyab.com](https://www.sahamyab.com/stocktwits) which is the Stocktwits.com version for the stock markets in Iran.
